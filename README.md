# C++ OOP Learning Project
This project is a collection of code exercises and examples to help me learn and practice key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. It covers topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and other fundamental OOP principles.

** Overview **

This repository contains various examples and exercises demonstrating the following key OOP concepts:

Inheritance: Understanding how one class can inherit properties and behavior from another class.

Polymorphism: Learning how objects can take on multiple forms through function overriding and dynamic dispatch.

Abstract Classes: Implementing abstract base classes and using them to enforce a structure for derived classes.

Encapsulation: Applying access control to class members using public, private, and protected visibility.

Object-Oriented Design: Exploring the principles of designing modular, reusable, and maintainable C++ code.

** Features **

Examples illustrating simple to complex inheritance hierarchies. Use of abstract classes and pure virtual functions to establish base class interfaces. Code samples that practice encapsulation, showing how data members can be protected from unauthorized access. Exercises for improving understanding of constructors, destructors, and copy assignment and copy operator= in C++.

 ** Lessons Learned **

Through this project, I aim to solidify my understanding of the foundational concepts of C++ OOP. As I continue to work on more advanced topics like templates, smart pointers, and design patterns, this repository will grow to reflect my learning journey.
